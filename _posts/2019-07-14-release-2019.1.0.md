Delight 2019.1.0 is released. Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/delight-dev/Delight) and [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/150494). If you're migrating from MarkLight check out the migration docs [here](Tutorials/MarkLightMigrationGuide), which also contains a detailed change log. Main highlights:

- Code Generation - no parsing during run-time, no reflection, everything accessed directly
- On-demand Loading (asynchronous load)
- Asset Management
- Game Model Integration (Defining/DDL, Binding, Referencing)
