Based on [Collection](Collection)

## Description

The list presents a static or dynamic list of items. The list can be set to be scrollable through the IsScrollable property. items can be made selectable. Items can be arranged vertically or horizontally. The items can overflow or be wrapped to create flowing lists.

## Dependency Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alignment | [ElementAlignment](../Types/ElementAlignment) | Used to align the view relative to the layout parent region it resides in. |
| Alpha | float | Can be used to adjust the alpha color of this view and all its children. E.g. used for fade in/out animations. Is separate from and different from the background color of the view as it affects the children as well. |
| AlternateItems | bool | Boolean indicating if the state of every other (odd) list items should be Alternate by default. Used to alternate the style of list items. |
| BackgroundAlphaHitTestMinimumThreshold | float | Alpha values less than the threshold will cause raycast events to pass through the view. |
| BackgroundColor | [Color](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Color.html) | Background color of the view. Color values can be specified by name (Red, Blue, Coral, etc), hexcode (#aarrggbb or #rrggbb) or rgb/rgba value ("1.0,0.0,0.5" or "1,1,1,0.5"). |
| BackgroundFillAmount | float | Amount of the view shown when BackgroundType is set to Filled. |
| BackgroundFillCenter | bool | Boolean indicating if the center of a Tiled or Sliced sprite should be rendered. |
| BackgroundFillClockwise | bool | Boolean indicating if the sprite should be filled clockwise or counter-clockwise. |
| BackgroundFillMethod | [FillMethod](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/FillMethod.html) | Enum indicating the background fill method. |
| BackgroundFillOrigin | int | Point of origin of the Fill process. Value means different things with each fill method. |
| BackgroundIsMaskingGraphic | bool | Boolean indicating if image is a masking graphic. |
| BackgroundMaskable | bool | Boolean indicating if the graphic allows masking. |
| BackgroundMaterial | [Material](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.html) | Material used by the sprite. |
| BackgroundOnCullStateChanged | [CullStateChangedEvent](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CullStateChangedEvent.html) | Callback called when the culling state of this graphic either becomes culled or visible. |
| BackgroundOverrideSprite | [Sprite](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Sprite.html) | Overrides the default sprite used by this view. |
| BackgroundPixelsPerUnitMultiplier | float | Pixel per unit modifier to change how sliced sprites are generated. |
| BackgroundPreserveAspect | bool | Boolean indicating if this sprite should preserve its aspect ratio. |
| BackgroundRaycastTarget | bool | Boolean indicating if the graphic should be considered a target for raycasting. |
| BackgroundSprite | [Sprite](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Sprite.html) | The background sprite of the view. The value is the name of the sprite asset file without extension, e.g. "mysprite". |
| BackgroundType | [Type](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Type.html) | Enum indicating what type of sprite the background is. |
| BackgroundUseSpriteMesh | bool | Boolean indicating if the view should use mesh generated by TextureImporter or a simple quad mesh. |
| BubbleNotifyChildLayoutChanged | bool | Boolean indicating if parent always should be notified when the child changes layout. |
| CanDeselect | bool | Boolean indicating if selected list items can be deselected by clicking on them again. |
| CanMultiSelect | bool | Boolean indicating if the user can select multiple list items. |
| CanReselect | bool | Boolean indicating if the selected item should be reselected if clicked on again. |
| CanSelect | bool | Boolean indicating if the user can select items in the list. |
| ContentAlignment | [ElementAlignment](../Types/ElementAlignment) | Alignment of the list items. |
| DeselectAfterSelect | bool | Boolean indicating if the item should immediatelly be deselected after being selected. |
| DisableItemArrangement | bool | Boolean indicating if the list shouldn't arrange its items. Used if items are arranged elsewhere. |
| DisableLayoutUpdate | bool | Boolean indicating if automatic layout updates for this view should be disabled. When disabled the view doesn't call UpdateLayout() when properties such as Width, Height, etc. changes. |
| EnableScriptEvents | bool | Boolean indicating if unity script events (Update, LateUpdate, Awake, etc) should be relayed to the view code-behind through the corresponding methods that can be overriden. |
| GameObject | [GameObject](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) | GameObject in the hierarchy that corresponds to the view. |
| Height | [ElementSize](../Types/ElementSize) | The height of the view in pixels or percents. |
| HorizontalSpacing | [ElementSize](../Types/ElementSize) | Horizontal spacing between the list items. |
| IgnoreFlip | bool | Used when doing localization override default behavior of flipping the view Right to Left or Left to Rigth. |
| IgnoreObject | bool | Boolean indicating if the view should be ignored. Ignored objects don't run any load logic and don't respond to property changed events. |
| IsActive | bool | Boolean indicating if the view is active. Deactivated views deactivates corresponding game object, components, renderers and scripts. |
| IsScrollable | bool | Boolean indicating if the list can be scrolled. |
| IsStatic | bool | Boolean indicating if the list is static. |
| IsVirtualized | bool | Boolean indicating if the list is virtualized. Virtualized lists have far better performance when dealing with large number of items as only items visible in the viewport are generated. |
| IsVisible | bool | Boolean indicating if view is visible or hidden. Invisible views still take up space but aren't interactable and have their alpha set to 0. |
| Items | [BindableCollection](../Types/BindableCollection) | The data collection that is used to generate the collection view items. |
| LayoutRoot | [LayoutRoot](LayoutRoot) | Reference to the layout root view that is the main UICanvas that manages layout updates. All UI views resides under a layout root. |
| LoadMode | [LoadMode](../Types/LoadMode) | Enum flags indicating when and how the view should be loaded by the framework. Can be changed when e.g. the view is to be loaded on-demand. |
| Margin | [ElementMargin](../Types/ElementMargin) | Adding margins to a view changes the size of the area in which its content resides, but it does not change the width or height of the view. |
| Offset | [ElementMargin](../Types/ElementMargin) | Determines the offset of the view. |
| OffsetFromParent | [ElementMargin](../Types/ElementMargin) | Offset set by a parent view. Used by views like Group to arrange children without changing their own Offset values. |
| Orientation | [ElementOrientation](../Types/ElementOrientation) | Orientation of the list. |
| Overflow | [OverflowMode](../Types/OverflowMode) | Enum indicating if items should overflow or wrap as they reach the boundaries of the list. Used to create flowing lists. |
| OverrideHeight | [ElementSize](../Types/ElementSize) | Overrides regular Height value. Used to e.g. automatically size items without changing the default Height value set. |
| OverrideWidth | [ElementSize](../Types/ElementSize) | Overrides regular Width value. Used to e.g. automatically size items without changing the default Width value set. |
| Padding | [ElementMargin](../Types/ElementMargin) | Adds padding to the list. |
| Pivot | [Vector2](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) | The pivot point of the view. |
| Position | [Vector3](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) | Directly sets the local position of the view relative to parent. Position otherwise set using the Alignment and Offset properties. |
| RaycastBlockMode | [RaycastBlockMode](../Types/RaycastBlockMode) | Enum indicating if raycasts should be blocked. |
| RealizationMargin | [Vector2](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) | Used when IsVirtualized is set to true and determines how close the list item needs to be to the visible viewport in order to be realized. |
| Rotation | [Quaternion](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Quaternion.html) | Rotation of the view. |
| Scale | [Vector3](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) | Scale of the view. |

| SelectOnMouseUp | bool | Boolean indicating if list items should be selected on mouse up. |
| SortDirection | [ElementSortDirection](../Types/ElementSortDirection) | Determines the sort direction of the list items. |
| Spacing | [ElementSize](../Types/ElementSize) | Horizontal and vertical spacing between the list items. |
| UseFastShader | bool | Boolean indicating if the default UI shader should be replaced by a simpler and faster one. The faster shader does not support masking and clipping. |
| VerticalSpacing | [ElementSize](../Types/ElementSize) | Vertical spacing between the list items. |
| Width | [ElementSize](../Types/ElementSize) | The width of the view in pixels or percents. |
