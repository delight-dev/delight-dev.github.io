## Component-oriented framework

Delight is a component-oriented framework for building well-structured and easily maintainable UI components (views) in Unity and integrate them with your game model. This document goes through the main features of the framework. 



## Views

Think of views as pieces of your game UI, like buttons, combo-boxes, windows, data grids, that like LEGO blocks can be combined into more advanced views like main menus, highscore lists, chat windows, etc. 

The framework makes it easy for you to create these reusable views that can then be shared, extended, styled, and plugged into different projects. 



## Styling

## Data-binding

## Data schemas
## On-demand loading
